1. Prefix

Definition:
A prefix of an array or string is a contiguous segment that starts at the first element and extends to any position in the array.

Formally, if you have an array A = [a0, a1, ..., an-1], then a prefix ending at index i is:

prefix 𝑖=[𝑎0,𝑎1,...,𝑎𝑖],0≤𝑖≤𝑛−1
prefix i=[a0,a1,...,ai],0≤i≤n−1

Properties of prefixes:

Starts at the beginning: Always begins at the first element.

Contiguous: Must include every element from the start up to index i.

Number of prefixes: An array of length n has exactly n non-empty prefixes (and optionally 1 empty prefix).

Length: The length of a prefix ending at index i is i+1.

Example:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]


Prefixes:

Prefix ending at 0: [1]

Prefix ending at 1: [1, 2]

Prefix ending at 2: [1, 2, 3]

Prefix ending at 3: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Optional empty prefix: []

Applications of prefix:

Prefix sum arrays: Store cumulative sums to answer range sum queries efficiently.

String algorithms: KMP algorithm uses prefix functions to find repeating patterns.

Dynamic programming: Often use prefixes for computing cumulative information like sums, max, min.

2. Suffix

Definition:
A suffix of an array or string is a contiguous segment that ends at the last element and starts at any position.

Formally, for A = [a0, a1, ..., an-1], a suffix starting at index i is:

suffix 𝑖=[𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑖+1,...,𝑎𝑛−1],0≤𝑖≤𝑛−1
suffix i=[ai,ai+1,...,an−1],0≤i≤n−1

Properties of suffixes:

Ends at the last element: Always terminates at the final element.

Contiguous: Includes every element from start index i to the end.

Number of suffixes: An array of length n has exactly n non-empty suffixes (and optionally 1 empty suffix).

Length: The length of a suffix starting at index i is n-i.

Example:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]


Suffixes:

Suffix starting at 0: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Suffix starting at 1: [2, 3, 4]

Suffix starting at 2: [3, 4]

Suffix starting at 3: [4]

Optional empty suffix: []
